mandel.cpp
mandel_pth.cpp -- naive pthreaded version (possibly too naive?)
  + Note that I had to make a few arguments global (because I couldn't use a lambda with a pthread_create)
  + Maybe a struct would have worked (what about casting?)
mandel_pth.1.cpp -- primitive pthread removal
  + Unsurprisingly, this is trivial and works out of the box
mandel_pth.2.cpp -- beginning shaping: remove empty for-loops
  + Removes the for loop that the pthread_join calls were in (not sure if this is part of the pth.1?)
mandel_pth.3.cpp -- Introduce TBB farm
  + As in blackscholes
